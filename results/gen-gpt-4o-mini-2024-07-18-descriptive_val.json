Similar to the x-axis, the exact number of labeled ticks is not visible, but there would typically be several labeled ticks at regular intervals.\n\nAssuming standard intervals for both axes, we can estimate:\n\n- **X-axis**: If there are ticks at intervals of 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300), that would give us 7 labeled ticks.\n- **Y-axis**: If there are ticks at intervals of 0.05 (0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40), that would give us 9 labeled ticks.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n- Total ticks = 7 (x-axis) + 9 (y-axis) = **16 labeled ticks**.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes is **16**."

Assuming there are ticks at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 steps), we can estimate the number of ticks. For example, if ticks are at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50, that would give us 11 ticks.\n\n2. **Y-axis ticks**: The y-axis typically ranges from 0 to 1 (or similar), and if ticks are placed at regular intervals (e.g., every 0.1), we would have ticks at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1, resulting in 11 ticks.\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n- X-axis ticks: 11\n- Y-axis ticks: 11\n\nTotal ticks = 11 (x-axis) + 11 (y-axis) = 22.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes for the subplot at row 4 and column 1 is **22**."

In this case, it appears there are ticks at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. This gives us **6 ticks**.\n\n2. **Y-axis (Number of mappings f)**: The ticks are labeled at intervals as well. The visible ticks appear to be at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. This gives us **6 ticks**.\n\nNow, we sum the ticks from both axes:\n\n- X-axis: 6 ticks\n- Y-axis: 6 ticks\n\nTotal = 6 + 6 = **12 ticks**.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in the subplot at row 2 and column 1 is **12**."

Typically, for a log scale, there are ticks at powers of 10 (e.g., 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, etc.). In this case, it appears there are ticks at 100, 101, 102, and 103, which gives us **4 ticks**.\n\n- **Y-axis (\"proportion (log-scale)\")**: Similar to the x-axis, the y-axis will also have ticks at specific intervals. The ticks are likely to be at values such as -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, etc. Based on the visible range, we can estimate there are **8 ticks**.\n\nNow, we sum the ticks from both axes:\n- X-axis ticks: 4\n- Y-axis ticks: 8\n\nTotal ticks = 4 + 8 = **12**.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in subplot (b) is **12**."

This gives us **5 ticks**.\n\n2. **Y-axis (string displacement)**: The ticks are labeled from -1.5 to 1.5, which typically includes ticks at -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5.

This gives us **3 ticks**.\n- The y-axis has ticks labeled with values ranging from 0.5 to 9.0 (based on the visual representation). The specific ticks are not explicitly labeled in the image, but we can estimate that there are likely around **5 ticks** based on the typical range and spacing.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n- **X-axis ticks**: 3\n- **Y-axis ticks**: 5\n\nTotal ticks = 3 (x-axis) + 5 (y-axis) = **8 ticks**.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in the specified subplot is **8**."

This gives us 9 ticks.\n2. **Y-axis (\"log MSE\")**: Depending on the range, it might have ticks at intervals (e.g., -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0). This gives us 10 ticks.\n\nNow, we add the ticks from both axes:\n\n- X-axis ticks: 9\n- Y-axis ticks: 10\n\nTotal ticks = 9 + 10 = **19**.\n\nThus, the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in subplot B2 is **19**."
